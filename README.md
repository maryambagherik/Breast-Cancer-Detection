# Breast-Cancer-Detection

I'm a data scientist who in 2019 starts to research on deep learning domain. 

Im this repository you can find the data sets from Kaggle and and an algorithm which classify the breast images to two groups of bening and malignant.

A deep learning algorithm that can detect breast cancer on screening mammograms images. The algorithm classify breast images and through training the image data, can detect/predict cancer.
